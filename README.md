# WhiteSource copy policy tool
The script allows copying policies automatically, from the template project/product to the newly created projects/products, and update existing projects with the template policy.
It should run periodically, in order to make sure that all the policies under the required projects/products are up to date.

### How to use the script
1. Create an empty project/product or few with the required template policy.
2. Tag an empty project/product with the following project tag: `key=Policy.Template.Source,  value=<yourUniqueTemplateName>`.
3. For a new project/product creation that requires the template policy, add the following project/product tag: `key=Policy.Template.Destination, value=<yourUniqueTemplateName>`. It can be added via the UI or as part of the Unified Agent run.
4. The template policy will be updated for the required projects/products.
   **Note:** Make sure that the tag `Policy.Template.Source` value is unique and is presented only in one project/product.

### What does the script do?
For each project/product in the system, the script extracts the Tag key called: `Policy.Template.Source`, and the tag key called `Policy.Template.Destination`. 
In the event, the tag value of the project/product with `Policy.Template.Source` tag key equals the tag value of the project/product with `Policy.Template.Destination` tag key, the script will do the following:
- Delete the existing policies from the project/product with `Policy.Template.Destination` tag key.
- Copy the project/product policies of the project/product with `Policy.Template.Source` tag key to the project/product with `Policy.Template.Destination` tag key.
